This is a project I completed as part of the summer class CS540: Intro to AI at the University of Wisconsin. It takes a random document 
(typically a movie script from https://imsdb.com/), and generates a new document based on character combination probabilities from the original document. 
Be advised, the algorithm isn't advanced enough to only assign valid english words to the new script, so a majority of the output will be gibberish, however 
it will contain a good amount of english words.
